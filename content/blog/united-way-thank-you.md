Thank you to United Way of Delaware County Ohio and their generous donation of $5,000. This has allowed us to implement Telehealth to be there for our patients during this difficult time! We could not have done it without you, and we are grateful to have you as a partner.

### Did you know?

+ Grace Clinics remain open for our patients' general health! 
+ Grace Clinics have been calling our patients to check-in on their wellbeing and offer alternatives to in person appointments!
+ The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act will let taxpayers **deduct up to $300 in charitable cash donations** from their 2020 taxable income even those who use the standard deduction! The CARES Act also provides for an enhanced deduction for corporations!

**Thank you for your ongoing support, prayers and donations!**
