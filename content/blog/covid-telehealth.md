If you have symptoms such as a cough, fatigue, nasal congestion, shortness of breath or fevers, and the symptoms are mild, please remain at home and follow the following measures:

+ Cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze
+ Avoid close contact with other people (preferably stay at least 6 feet away)
+ Wash your hands and clean your house frequently
+ Get extra rest
+ Drink plenty of fluids
+ Take any over the counter medications that you would typically take to treat the flu or a cold

If your symptoms are severe or they worsen (e.g. chest tightness, new confusion, increased shortness of breath) please go to the Emergency Room and limit contact with other people as much as possible.
