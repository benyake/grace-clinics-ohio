Grace Clinic is having their 4th Annual Golf Outing October 17th at Glenross Golf Club. Since we are not able to do the dinner portion of our annual fundraising and there has been a decrease in funding, our Golf Outing is more important than ever. We have seen an increase in patients due to financial hardships and increased illness this year. We have been able to continue providing free medical care to those who are struggling thanks to our financial supporters.

Our Golf Outing needs… Sponsors at all levels (see flyer) Raffle Baskets Prizes Golfers – if you don’t golf don’t worry, it’s a scramble which means you take the best ball of the group.
