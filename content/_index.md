          Our clinics offer walk-in services to patients who are unable to find a provider elsewhere, but we offer limited services and are not comparable to a full service primary care physician. We treat minor illnesses and injuries. We do not offer prenatal care, casting, psychiatric treatment or substance abuse treatment.
