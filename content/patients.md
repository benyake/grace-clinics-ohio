        subtitle: Grace Clinics of Ohio are free clinics available to anyone whose income is at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. We do see patients who have insurance or Medicaid and are unable to find a provider elsewhere, but we offer limited services and are not comparable to a full service primary care physician.
