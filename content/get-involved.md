      - title: How old do I need to be to volunteer?
        content: >-
          While we do not have any age restrictions, our volunteers help fulfill our mission to love God and love people through free medical care. Our volunteers are committed to furthering that mission by supporting our clinic, programs, and events dedicated to providing free medical care to people that would otherwise not have access to it.
      - title: What do I need to bring?
        content: >-
          If you are a licensed provider please bring your drivers license and any applicable immunization record to your profession. We provide coffee and water. Dinner is provided for the Wednesday night clinic volunteers in Delaware.
      - title: What should I wear?
        content: >-
          The clinics are very casual. Most volunteers wear jeans. Scrubs are welcome too, if you prefer.
      - title: Where do I park?
        content: >-
          While it may vary by clinic, there is often parking at the back entrance.
      - title: Other questions?
